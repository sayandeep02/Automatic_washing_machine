![alt text](images/1.png)
## Introduction

This project involves designing an automatic washing machine control system using Verilog HDL. The main stages of the washing process, such as closing the door, filling water, adding detergent, cycling, draining, and spinning, are implemented as a State Machine. This project utilizes Finite State Machines (FSM) to represent various real-life scenarios and includes a test bench to observe the working of the machine. The implementation is done using Xilinx ISE 14.7.

## Features

- **Finite State Machine**: Represents the main stages of the washing process.
- **Test Bench**: Allows observation and testing of the washing machine's working.
- **FPGA Implementation**: Demonstrates the code on FPGA.
- **Extendable**: The code serves as a basis for implementing additional features like different washing modes based on clothing material, temperature, etc.
